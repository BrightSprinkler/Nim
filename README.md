# Nim

## Concept

A basic game of Nim. You play against an AI, which is displayed as a female character - introducing the player into the game and how to play.

There will be 15 matches / sticks / whatever.
Either the player or the AI start the game.
Take between 1 and 3 matches away alternating between each player / AI.
The one taking the last match wins.

After every round the player will get a task, correlating to the number of the last match removed.
So there will be at least 15 tasks.

Losing the game leads to denial.
The player can start another round to try again, leading into a loop that either end with denial or an orgasm.
The game length can thereby vary.

Winning the game earns the player an orgasm.

### Who Starts The Game?

The following options can be a possibility:

* The player starts always
* The AI starts always
* The beginner is determined by random (e.g. coin flip)
* The player gets challenge from the AI, if the player succeeds the player starts the game

The last options seems the most fun and interactive.

#### Starting Challenge

## Settings

The following settings can be modified by the player.

### Match Count

By default the count of matches per game is 15.
The player can decide to increase the match count to a multiple of 15.

Theoretically any amount of matches is possible, however I want to animate the whole match taking thing. Therefore an image set needs to be created and in order to do that the base count of matches needs to be known.

### Hentai

By default hentai will be to go to visuals.
This can be toggeld off to use real 3d humans.

### CBT

By default cbt will be toggeld off.
Tasks related to cbt can be enabled using this setting.

Every 15 base tasks will get an alternative cbt themed task.
If cbt is enabled a coinflip (50/50 chance) will determine if the original or the cbt task will be played.

### Only Pain

By default only pain will be toggeld off.

By enabling only pain, cbt will be toggeld on as well.
The 15 base tasks will not be used - only the 15 cbt tasks remain.

### Difficulty

The difficulty of winning a game is determined by the AI.

#### Very Easy

100% of the picks the AI takes matches by random.

#### Easy

75% of the picks the AI takes matches by random.
25% of the picks the AI takes matches by the "Very Hard"-Alogrithm.

#### Medium

50% of the picks the AI takes matches by random.
50% of the picks the AI takes matches by the "Very Hard"-Alogrithm.

#### Hard

25% of the picks the AI takes matches by random.
75% of the picks the AI takes matches by the "Very Hard"-Alogrithm.

#### Very Hard

The AI picks the amount of matches to take away using modulo 4.
Once you fuck up or don't start the game it is probably over for the player.

### Auto Play

By default the player will deceide the count of matches to take away each round.

Enabling auto play replaces the players manuall decision with an automatic AI decision.
For this decision a difficulty level can be picked as well.
Basically 2 AIs are playing against each other and the game can be played in a "Hands Free"-Mode.
